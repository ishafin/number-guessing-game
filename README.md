# Number Guessing Game
This program generates a random number and asks the player to guess it. If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower number please”. Similarly, if the player’s guess is too low, the program prints “Higher number please”.
When the player guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player took to arrive at the number.
